    Covers utility-scale power/district-heating technologies, individual

    renewable-fuel production routes.

    Carbon-capture technologies are reported on a Euro/tCO2(/h) basis rather
    than Euro/kW; their rows carry `CO2_BASIS_UNITS` in the `unit` column
    instead of the power/heat schema, and `TechnologyCostDatabase` reads that
    unit back out of the data rather than assuming a fixed one per variable.
    DEA's oxy-fuel capture and CO2 transport/storage/liquefaction entries are
    *not* included (out of scope for a technology cost database: they price
    logistics infrastructure, not a conversion technology).

    Raw data is downloaded once from DEA's own stable media links (see `_SOURCES`) and
    cached
    locally under `self.path` as an "alldata_flat" export per source, matching the
    legacy
    script's approach (its original `ens.dk/sites/ens.dk/files/...` URLs no longer
    resolve) and
    the other agencies' checked-in-local-file convention.

    DEA revises this catalogue continuously; a handful of technologies were renamed or
    restructured by revisions made since this class was first ported (see
    `_MAIN_TECHS_LITERAL`,
    `_LABEL_SUFFIXES`, and the `pyrolysis` entries in `_RF_TECHS`/`_RF_COST_PARS` for
    specifics).
    If DEA renames or restructures a technology again, re-verify this file's mappings
    against a
    delete-and-refetch of the affected file in `self.path`.

    District heating distribution-network data are available separately via
    `get_dh_distribution_data`, in DEA's own native units (`€/km²` capacity, not `€/kW`)
